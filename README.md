# User guide

- Landing page is just an ugly landing page, runaway from it as quickly as possible by clicking on a big button in a middle of a screen.
- You will be redirected to page where you can browse books, you can keep browsing and view book details, but to add to cart/purchase book, you will have to login.
- At this point you probably noticed navbar at top of the page, navbars links go as follow(from left to right):
1. "Poƒçetna" - back to landing
2. "Knjige" - page you're on right now
3. "eKnjige" - same page as "Knjige", but displaying eBooks in the offer.
4. "Prijava" - sign in
5. "Registracija" - sign up

If you want to sign up on the preview project, please use dummy data. Project uses basic joi validation, so make sure that email has a proper email structure (E.G. example@example.com) and that password has at least 6 characters.

To sign in into preview project I've prepared a few test accounts: test user 1-5, with password 123456 (E.G.  username: test user 1, password: 123456).

App supports accounts with 2 levels of privileges: "user" and "admin"
User account - has only necessary functionalities for users ( add to cart, remove from cart, buy book, edit email address...)
Admin account - has all user functionalities + ability to add/edit/delete books

All test accounts on the preview application have user privileges.
